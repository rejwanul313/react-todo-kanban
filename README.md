# react-todo-kanban
You are required to build a Todo List Application using React.js. This application will feature a Kanban-style interface with three distinct columns: New, Ongoing, and Done. Each column will serve as a container for the todo items, allowing users to manage tasks through different stages of completion. 

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```
